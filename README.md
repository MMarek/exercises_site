# Page with exercises.
Simple web witch many exercises. Arrays, loops, functions... 

built in React.

## General info
I've decided to have all of my academic exercises in one place.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React
* Js
* Css/ (Sass) ?

## Features
#####Arrays: 
```
Tasks are presented in a user-friendly way.

```

  
- Loops: 
    - 1 - a small program calculating the factorial, made in two different ways.
    - 2 - program that sums all given numbers in the range from x to y.
    - 3 - alternating `'+' and '-' `program with loop in a loop, and after all iterations the program 
    starts from a new line.
    - 4 - table with random numbers with 15 places inside, from 1 to 10 
    (each refresh of the page gives a new set of numbers).	
    Then the loop in the loop calculates how many numbers from the result are repeated.
